# Coding in HCL

Every programming language has its own syntax and semantics, and HCL too has them. Being a Turing-Complete language, this language supports

1. General Input/Output
2. Type Conversion
3. Conditionals and Loops
4. Functions
5. Object-Oriented Programming
6. Modular Programming

and many more.... Let's see each of them in detail

## Comments

HCL supports single and Multiline comments.

1. Single-line comments start with a `#` character
2. Multi-line comments starts with `#[` character and ends with `]`

There is also support for nested comments, wherein the user can nest comments in their program.

Proper usage of comments is encouraged in HCL. Most of the code is self-explanatory. Thus, programs must not be filled up with comments. Use comments before functions and blocks of code where explanation is necessary. This makes your code neat and readable for other programmers.
